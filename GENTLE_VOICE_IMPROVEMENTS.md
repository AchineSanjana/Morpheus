# Gentle Voice Improvements for Morpheus Sleep App

## 🎧 What Was Changed

Your Morpheus app's voice has been significantly improved to be much more gentle, human-like, and conducive to falling asleep. Here are all the enhancements made:

### 1. 🎛️ Optimized Voice Settings
- **Slower Speech Rate**: Reduced from 150 to 120 words per minute for deeply relaxing speech
- **Softer Volume**: Lowered from 0.8 to 0.7 for gentleness
- **Lower Pitch**: Set to -10 for a more soothing, warmer voice tone
- **Gentle Mode**: Enabled special gentle speech patterns

### 2. 🗣️ Enhanced Voice Selection
- **Prioritized Gentle Voices**: System now looks for specifically calm voices (Zira, Hazel, Susan, Anna, Emma, Linda)
- **Smart Voice Matching**: Falls back to female voices, then any available voice
- **Natural Voice Preference**: Uses the most human-like voices available on your system

### 3. ⏸️ Natural Speech Pauses
- **Breathing Points**: Added gentle pauses (represented by "...") after sentences and commas
- **Transitional Pauses**: Enhanced pauses around calming phrases like "Meanwhile", "Slowly", "Gently"
- **Dialogue Breathing**: Natural pauses before quoted speech
- **Sentence Flow**: Longer pauses between sentences for relaxed listening

### 4. 🎵 Audio Post-Processing (When Available)
- **Volume Normalization**: Prevents sudden loud parts that could disturb sleep
- **Gentle Fade In/Out**: Smooth 2-second fades to avoid jarring starts/stops
- **Softer Dynamics**: Reduced overall volume by 3dB for bedtime listening
- **Frequency Softening**: Reduced harsh frequencies for warmer, more soothing sound

### 5. 📊 Updated Metadata
- **Accurate Duration**: Accounts for slower speech and added pauses (effective rate: ~96 WPM)
- **Audio Effects Info**: Reports which gentle processing features are active
- **Speech Settings**: Shows all the gentle mode settings being used

## 🎯 The Result

Your bedtime stories now have:
- ✅ **Much slower, more relaxed speech pace**
- ✅ **Natural breathing points and pauses**
- ✅ **Softer, more soothing voice tone**

## 🧪 Testing

The improvements have been tested and verified. You can test them by:

## 📁 Files Modified

- `backend/app/audio_service.py` - All voice and audio improvements
- `backend/requirements.txt` - Added pydub for audio processing
- `backend/test_gentle_voice.py` - Test script to verify improvements

## 💡 Pro Tips

- The voice will be significantly more relaxing and human-like
- Audio generation may take slightly longer due to the enhanced processing
- The gentler pace means longer audio files, but much better for sleep
- If pydub audio processing isn't available on your system, the core improvements (speed, pauses, voice selection) will still work perfectly
