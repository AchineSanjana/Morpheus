## 2. Responsible AI Practices

### 2.1 Overview

Morpheus integrates **fairness, explainability, transparency, and privacy** as first-class system features, not afterthoughts. Every AI interaction passes through a comprehensive responsible AI validation layer.

### 2.2 Fairness Implementation

#### **2.2.1 Bias Detection & Prevention**

**Automated Bias Scanning**:
```python
fairness_patterns = {
    "age_bias": [r"\b(too old|too young|at your age)\b"],
    "gender_bias": [r"\b(men|women) (should|typically)\b"],
    "cultural_bias": [r"\ball people from [A-Z][a-z]+\b"],
    "socioeconomic_bias": [r"\bexpensive solutions only\b"],
    "accessibility_bias": [r"\bjust walk|simply avoid\b"],
}
```

**Fairness Checks**:
1. **Inclusive Language Scoring**: Analyzes response for inclusive terminology
2. **Stereotype Detection**: Flags assumptions about user groups
3. **Alternative Solutions**: Ensures free/accessible options alongside premium recommendations
4. **Accessibility Considerations**: Validates recommendations work for diverse abilities

**Example**:
- ❌ **Biased**: "At your age, you should expect worse sleep quality"
- ✅ **Fair**: "Sleep quality varies by individual. Based on YOUR data, here's what we see..."

#### **2.2.2 Fairness Scoring System**

**Inclusive Language Score** (0.0 - 1.0):
- **0.9-1.0**: Excellent - fully inclusive language
- **0.7-0.89**: Good - mostly inclusive with minor improvements possible
- **0.5-0.69**: Fair - needs significant improvement
- **< 0.5**: Poor - response should be regenerated

**Implementation**:
```python
def _calculate_inclusive_language_score(self, text: str) -> float:
    score = 1.0
    # Detect exclusionary language patterns
    if any(pattern in text.lower() for pattern in exclusionary_terms):
        score -= 0.2
    # Check for alternative options
    if "alternatively" in text or "you could also" in text:
        score += 0.1
    return min(max(score, 0.0), 1.0)
```

### 2.3 Explainability & Transparency

#### **2.3.1 Transparent Decision-Making**

**Every AI Response Includes**:
1. **Data Sources**: What sleep logs were analyzed
2. **Decision Factors**: Which patterns influenced recommendations
3. **Confidence Levels**: How certain the AI is about predictions
4. **Limitations**: What the AI cannot determine from available data

**Example Response Metadata**:
```json
{
  "response": "Based on your 7-day pattern, consider moving bedtime 30min earlier...",
  "transparency": {
    "data_sources": ["Sleep logs from Oct 15-21", "Caffeine intake patterns"],
    "decision_factors": {
      "avg_sleep_duration": "6.2 hours (below your 7hr goal)",
      "caffeine_timing": "Consumed within 6hrs of bedtime on 4/7 days",
      "consistency_score": 0.65
    },
    "confidence": 0.82,
    "limitations": "Cannot account for untracked stress factors"
  }
}
```

#### **2.3.2 Action Type Classification**

**Transparency Required Actions**:
- `personalized_recommendation`: Explain why this advice is for this user
- `data_analysis`: Show which data points were analyzed
- `pattern_detection`: Describe patterns found and their significance
- `risk_assessment`: Justify risk levels with data
- `behavioral_change_suggestion`: Explain expected outcomes

**Validation**:
```python
async def check_transparency(self, text: str, action_type: str) -> ResponsibleAICheck:
    if action_type in self.transparency_required_actions:
        # Ensure explanation present
        if not self._contains_explanation(text):
            return ResponsibleAICheck(
                passed=False,
                risk_level=RiskLevel.MEDIUM,
                message="Response lacks reasoning explanation"
            )
```

#### **2.3.3 AI Attribution & Limitations**

**Every Response Clearly States**:
- "This is AI-generated advice based on sleep science principles"
- "Consult a healthcare provider for persistent sleep issues"
- "AI cannot diagnose medical conditions"

**Implementation in Base Agent**:
```python
class BaseAgent:
    async def handle(self, message: str, context: AgentContext):
        response = await self.generate_response(message, context)
        
        # Add AI attribution
        response.metadata["ai_generated"] = True
        response.metadata["limitations"] = self.get_limitations()
        
        return response
```

### 2.4 Privacy Protection

#### **2.4.1 Data Minimization**

**Collection Principles**:
- ✅ **Only Sleep-Related**: No unnecessary personal data collected
- ✅ **User Controlled**: Users can export/delete data anytime
- ✅ **Anonymized Analytics**: System metrics don't include user identifiers
- ✅ **No Third-Party Sharing**: Data never sold or shared

**User Profile - Minimal Data**:
```python
@dataclass
class UserProfile:
    id: UUID
    age: Optional[int]  # Optional for better privacy
    sleep_goal: str
    # NO: Full name, address, SSN, payment info
```

#### **2.4.2 Privacy-Sensitive Data Detection**

**Automated Scanning**:
```python
privacy_patterns = {
    "personal_identifiers": [
        r"\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b",  # SSN patterns
        r"\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b"  # Email
    ],
    "medical_details": [
        r"\bmedication:|prescription:|diagnosis:"
    ],
    "financial_info": [
        r"\bcredit card|bank account|\$\d+,?\d*"
    ]
}
```

**If Detected**:
1. **Redact**: Remove sensitive info from AI responses
2. **Alert**: Log privacy violation attempt
3. **Educate**: Inform user not to share such data

#### **2.4.3 User Data Rights (GDPR Compliance)**

**Implemented Rights**:

1. **Right to Access**: 
```python
@app.get("/user/export")
async def export_user_data(authorization: str):
    # Returns complete user data in JSON format
    return {
        "profile": user_profile,
        "sleep_logs": sleep_logs,
        "conversations": chat_history
    }
```

2. **Right to Deletion**:
```python
@app.delete("/user/account")
async def delete_user_account(authorization: str):
    # Permanently deletes all user data
    await delete_user_profile()
    await delete_sleep_logs()
    await delete_conversations()
```

3. **Right to Rectification**: Users can edit all their data via UI

4. **Right to Portability**: Data exportable in standard JSON format

#### **2.4.4 Privacy Policy Integration**

**In-App Privacy Disclosure**:
- `PrivacyPolicy.tsx`: Modal accessible from auth and main UI
- Clear language about data collection, usage, retention
- Contact information for privacy questions
- Version tracking for policy updates

### 2.5 Security & Responsible AI Synergy

#### **2.5.1 Prompt Injection Prevention**

**Multi-Layer Defense**:
1. **Input Validation**: Regex patterns detect injection attempts
2. **Content Sanitization**: Remove dangerous characters/patterns
3. **Output Validation**: Ensure AI doesn't leak system prompts
4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent brute-force attack attempts

**Example**:
```python
INJECTION_PATTERNS = [
    r"ignore previous instructions",
    r"system prompt:",
    r"<\|endoftext\|>",
    r"jailbreak"
]
```

#### **2.5.2 Responsible AI Audit Logging**

**Every Check Logged**:
```python
@dataclass
class ResponsibleAIAuditLog:
    timestamp: datetime
    user_id: UUID
    action_type: str
    fairness_score: float
    transparency_score: float
    privacy_violations: List[str]
    risk_level: RiskLevel
```

**Use Cases**:
- Monitor system fairness over time
- Identify recurring bias patterns
- Compliance audits
- Continuous improvement
