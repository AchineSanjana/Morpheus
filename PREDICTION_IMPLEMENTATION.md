- **Duration Prediction**: Estimates sleep duration based on lifestyle factors
- **Optimal Bedtime Calculation**: Personalized bedtime recommendations based on user patterns

#### 📊 Key Features
- **Multi-factor Analysis**: Considers caffeine, alcohol, screen time, stress, exercise, consistency
- **Historical Pattern Learning**: Builds user sleep profiles from logged data
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides prediction confidence levels (50-95%)
- **Risk Factor Identification**: Highlights factors that may impact sleep quality
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Generates personalized sleep improvement tips

#### 🔧 Technical Implementation
- Uses Python's `statistics` module for calculations (no ML dependencies initially)
- Extensible architecture for future ML model integration
- Integrated with existing responsible AI framework
- Fallback mechanisms for error handling

### 2. **Integration with Coordinator** (`backend/app/agents/coordinator.py`)

- ✅ Added prediction agent to coordinator's agent registry
- ✅ Updated LLM routing to recognize prediction keywords
- ✅ Enhanced welcome menu with prediction options
- ✅ Intelligent routing for prediction-related queries

### 3. **Enhanced Analytics** (`backend/app/agents/analyst.py`)

- ✅ Added predictive insights to existing 7-day analytics
- ✅ Trend-based predictions for sleep patterns
- ✅ Forward-looking recommendations

### 4. **Frontend Quick Actions** (`frontend/src/components/Chat.tsx`)

- ✅ Added prediction quick-action buttons to welcome menu
- ✅ Color-coded prediction options (purple for predictions, blue for bedtime)
- ✅ Intuitive UI for accessing prediction features

### 5. **Updated Dependencies** (`backend/requirements.txt`)

- ✅ Added numpy and scikit-learn for future ML enhancements
- ✅ Backward compatible with existing setup

## 🚀 How to Use the Prediction Features

   - Ask: "How will I sleep tonight?"
   - Ask: "Predict my sleep quality"
   - Click the "🔮 Predict Tonight" quick button

2. **⏰ Get Optimal Bedtime Recommendation**
   - Ask: "What's my optimal bedtime?"
   - Ask: "When should I go to bed to wake up at 7:00?"
   - Click the "⏰ Optimal Bedtime" quick button

3. **📈 View Predictive Insights**
   - Automatically included in 7-day analytics reports
   - Ask: "Show me my sleep predictions"
   - Provides trend-based forecasts

### **Sample Predictions:**

```
🔮 Sleep Quality Prediction for Tonight

Predicted Quality: Good (7.2/10)
Expected Duration: 7.8 hours
Confidence: 78%

Based on your current patterns and today's activities, I predict your sleep 
quality will be good tonight. Your consistent bedtime routine and moderate 
caffeine intake today support this positive forecast.

✅ Positive Factors:
• No late caffeine consumption - supports natural sleep onset
• Exercise today - improves sleep quality and depth

⚠️ Risk Factors:
• High screen time may suppress melatonin production

💡 Recommendations:
• 📱 Enable night mode and reduce screen time 1-2 hours before bed
• 🌙 Keep your bedroom cool (65-68°F) and dark for best sleep quality
```

## 🎯 Prediction Accuracy Features

### **Confidence Scoring System:**
- **Base Confidence**: 70%
- **Historical Data Bonus**: +10-15% (with 14+ logs)
- **Consistency Bonus**: +15% (>70% schedule consistency)
- **Risk Penalties**: -10% (extreme stress/screen time)
- **Range**: 50-95% confidence

### **Prediction Categories:**
- **Excellent** (8.5-10): Optimal conditions
- **Good** (7.0-8.4): Favorable patterns
- **Fair** (5.5-6.9): Mixed indicators
- **Poor** (4.0-5.4): Multiple risk factors
- **Very Poor** (<4.0): High-risk conditions

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### **Data Flow:**
1. **User Input** → Coordinator Agent
2. **Routing Decision** → Prediction Agent (for prediction queries)
3. **Context Analysis** → Historical logs + current factors
4. **Prediction Calculation** → Rule-based models
5. **AI Enhancement** → Gemini LLM for explanations
6. **Response Generation** → Formatted predictions + recommendations

### **Scalability:**
- **Rule-based Models**: Current implementation (immediate deployment)
- **ML Integration Ready**: Architecture supports future scikit-learn models
- **Real-time Adaptation**: Learns from user patterns over time
